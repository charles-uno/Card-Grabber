`grabber.py` shows information and images for randomly-chosen Magic cards. If something isn't present locally, it's scraped from online.

`builder.py` chops up transform cards and spits up corresponding Kamigawa-style flip cards.

Requires Matplotlib and BeautifulSoup.

TODO: Stick this in a Docker container!
